Maybe my expectations were already set too high after that beautiful movie of &ldquo;night in paradise&rdquo;, but whereas in that case I was left in awe, in this case I felt angry and dissatisfied. Warning: may contain spoilers.</h4>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;In the near future, a financial crisis will hit Korea and slums arise.  From those areas, a group of young people commit crime to survive.&rdquo;</em> So the summary says on Wikipedia.</strong></p>
<p>I chose this movie looking for something light to watch and packed with action, so probably I shouldn&rsquo;t have expected a masterpiece in the first place. But nevertheless I did not enjoy it that much. First of all there something that felt &ldquo;off&rdquo; all throughout. Maybe it was the setting. That &ldquo;dystopian future&rdquo; that felt poorly developed in the plot and only functioned as a backdrop, but never felt really necessary for the story. Or maybe the characters, also a bit too stereotypical to be relatable and generally poorly developed as well.</p>
<p>There was nothing about this dystopia that really had an impact in the story, and neither the atmosphere, if not just as a justification of the big &ldquo;heist&rdquo; that the street gang wants to organize, but nothing else.</p>
<p>The kids are supposed to be &ldquo;poor&rdquo;, but you never get this feeling when they drive cool-ass looking cars, they sport sleek haircuts (talking to you, Ki-hoon) or they have expensive-looking phones. So they kinda look like a bunch or rich kids in a poor neighbourhood, even if that wasn&rsquo;t completely intentional. None of them is really standing out with their personality, except maybe for Jang-ho, the most interesting one. But everyone else is so blank and stereotypical.</p>
<p>Dialogues are flat and they tend to be overly descriptive, completely missing the point of the &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; rule.</p>
<p>But honestly the real flaw was the script itself. The cringe-y plot-twist where (spoiler alert!) the hitman step back from its misison makes you wanna give up with the rest of the movie. I mean, i get it. It&rsquo;s part of the weirdness of the character, but come on! Doesn&rsquo;t make any sense and at that point I was lost.</p>
<p>What saves this movie from a failure is the good direction. Despite all the flaws previously mentioned, there&rsquo;s a good build-up of tension that keeps you hooked till the final resolution, and the cinematography is  top-notch. Especially that moment on the road that seemed to be coming out of Valhalla Rising, and I don&rsquo;t think it was completely a coincidence. On the contrary, it was a very cool reference that I appreciated.</p>
<p>Honestly it wasn&rsquo;t a completely <em><strong>bad</strong></em> movie. I think it had some good ideas behind, but they were poorly executed and the final product is not completely convincing. But hey! I&rsquo;ve heard that Netflix <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/squid-games-netflix-remake-korean-movie-time-to-hunt-adam-randall-1234871237/">is going to produce a series</a> out of this movie, so I guess I&rsquo;m the only one who didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t take just my words. You may too end up liking it in the end!</p>
